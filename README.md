The project is written in Python. 
1) Connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
2) Using SQL queries, we get data (average and maximum for given columns for a given period)
3) Using the Pandas library, save the data in a DataFrame, and then write the data to Excel
4) OK, I received the Excel file I needed with the necessary data
